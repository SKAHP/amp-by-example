# AMP by Example in Polymer

By accessing [https://www.ampbyexample.com/polymer](https://www.ampbyexample.com/polymer) you will access to the same AMP samples embedded in a Polymer shell.

## Installation

1. By running the AMPByeExample build scripts, the Polymer files will also be available. If you just want to build the polymer files:

  ```none
  $ gulp build:polymer
  ```

2. If everything went well, `gulp backend:watch` should now be running the site on <http://localhost:8080/polymer>
